# Cpp2IL - Reverse Engineering for VRChat üéÆüîç

Welcome to the **Cpp2IL** repository! The Unity IL2CPP of the popular game **VRChat** allows developers to reverse engineer and analyze the game's assembly files. Whether you're a game developer, modder, or just curious about the internals of **VRChat**, the **Cpp2IL** repository provides the necessary resources.

## üìÇ Overview of DLL Files

This repository contains a collection of .dll files extracted from the VRChat game. You can utilize these files with decompiler tools like **ILSpy**, **dnSpy**, and **DotPeek** to analyze the game's structure and functionality. Below is a list of the included .dll files:

| DLL File Name                  | Size     | Description                          |
|---------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll   | 738KB    | Core assembly for first pass scripts. |
| Assembly-CSharp.dll             | 10.2MB   | Main assembly containing C# code for the game. |
| AVProVideo.Extensions.Timeline.dll | 3.00KB | Extensions for AVPro video timeline functionality. |
| ...                             | ...      | ... (Add more rows as needed)         |

*Note: The complete list of .dll files can be found in the root directory.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nestor-vrc/Cpp2IL.git
    cd Cpp2IL
    ```

2. **Choose your decompiler**:
   You can use any of the following tools for analysis:
   - [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)
